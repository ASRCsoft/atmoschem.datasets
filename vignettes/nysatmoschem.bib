In this paper, we further evaluated the applications and limitations of using DC as both a qualitative and semi-quantitative woodsmoke marker via joint continuous measurements of PM$_{\textrm{2. 5}}$ (by nephelometer pDR-1500) and light-absorptive PM (by 2-wavelength and 7-wavelength Aethalometer{\textless}span style="position:relative; bottom:0.5em; " class="text"{\textgreater}®{\textless}/span{\textgreater}) in three northeastern US cities/towns including Rutland, VT; Saranac Lake, NY and Ithaca, NY. Residential wood combustion has shown to be the predominant source of wintertime primary PM$_{\textrm{2. 5}}$ emissions in both Rutland and Saranac Lake, where we conducted ambient measurements. In Ithaca, we performed woodsmoke plume measurements. We compared the pDR-1500 against a FEM PM$_{\textrm{2. 5}}$ sampler (BAM 1020), and identified a close agreement between the two instruments in a woodsmoke-dominated ambient environment. The analysis of seasonal and diurnal trends of DC, black carbon (BC, 880{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}nm) and PM$_{\textrm{2. 5}}$ concentrations supports the use of DC as an adequate qualitative marker. The strong linear relationships between PM$_{\textrm{2. 5}}$ and DC in both woodsmoke-dominated ambient and plume environments suggest that DC can reasonably serve as a semi-quantitative woodsmoke marker. We propose a DC-based indicator for woodsmoke emission, which has shown to exhibit a relatively strong linear relationship with heating demand. While we observed reproducible PM$_{\textrm{2. 5}}$–DC relationships in similar woodsmoke-dominated ambient environments, those relationships differ significantly with different environments, and among individual woodsmoke sources. Our analysis also indicates the potential for PM$_{\textrm{2. 5}}$–DC relationships to be utilized to distinguish different combustion and operating conditions of woodsmoke sources, and that DC–heating-demand relationships could be adopted to estimate woodsmoke emissions. However, future studies are needed to elucidate those relationships.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Wood smoke from forest fires or anthropogenic activities can be a significant contributor to
regional haze and PM2.5, but routine methods to quantify the extent of this source’s contribution
to visibility impairment and ambient levels of PM2.5 have not been developed and evaluated.
This paper evaluates an approach to semi-quantitatively measure the fraction of PM that is from
wood smoke (WS PM) in real-time. A two-wavelength AethalometerTM (Magee Scientific model
AE42) was used to measure the optical absorption of PM-1 ambient aerosol at 880 nm (BC) and
370 nm (UV-C). Certain organic aerosol components of wood smoke PM have enhanced optical
absorption at 370 relative to 880 nm (“Delta-C”). This enhanced absorption is shown to be a
specific "indicator" of WS PM, but alone is not a quantitative mass measurement. Improved
quantification of WS PM can be obtained when the two-channel Aethalometer is collocated with
continuous PM2.5 and other measurements.

A pilot study was performed to evaluate the potential for this approach in Rutland, VT between
February and July, 2004. Aethalometer measurements were made at an existing VT-DEC
monitoring site, collocated with continuous PM2.5, SO2, CO, and NOx measurements. Rutland
is a valley city surrounded by elevated terrain and subject to strong winter morning inversions,
and winter PM2.5 sample filters from this site often exhibit a distinct “wood smoke odor”. Local
mobile sources also contribute to the observed PM and BC concentrations (but not Delta-C) at
this site, primarily during weekday morning rush hour periods. Monitoring was performed
during seasons with and without wood smoke to allow assessment of mobile source signatures
without heating sources, since both have large BC components. The UNMIX model was used to
apportion measured PM2.5 into several source categories; NOx and SO2 are used to distinguish
PM contributions from WS, oil burning (primarily space heating), and mobile sources. WS PM
was associated only with the Aethalometer Delta-C measurement even in the presence of
substantial local mobile source and oil-burning aerosols.},

Detecting outliers by determining an interval spanning over the mean plus/minus three standard deviations remains a common practice. However, since both the mean and the standard deviation are particularly sensitive to outliers, this method is problematic. We highlight the disadvantages of this method and present the median absolute deviation, an alternative and more robust measure of dispersion that is easy to implement. We also explain the procedures for calculating this indicator in SPSS and R software.},

domains. However, due to a variety of constraints they are cumbersome to
ingest, wrangle, analyze, and share in a reproducible fashion. These
obstructions hamper thorough peer-review and thus disrupt the forward progress
