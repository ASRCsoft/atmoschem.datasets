	abstract = {One approach to identifying outliers is to assume that the outliers have a different distribution from the remaining observations. In this article we define outliers in terms of their position relative to the model for the good observations. The outlier identification problem is then the problem of identifying those observations that lie in a so-called outlier region. Methods based on robust statistics and outward testing are shown to have the highest possible breakdown points in a sense derived from Donoho and Huber. But a more detailed analysis shows that methods based on robust statistics perform better with respect to worst-case behavior. A concrete outlier identifier based on a suggestion of Hampel is given.},

	abstract = {A survey revealed that researchers still seem to encounter difficulties to cope with outliers. Detecting outliers by determining an interval spanning over the mean plus/minus three standard deviations remains a common practice. However, since both the mean and the standard deviation are particularly sensitive to outliers, this method is problematic. We highlight the disadvantages of this method and present the median absolute deviation, an alternative and more robust measure of dispersion that is easy to implement. We also explain the procedures for calculating this indicator in SPSS and R software.},
